================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The get() method is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere. If this method contains sensitive information, it could pose a security risk.
Solution: Restrict the access level of your methods according to their usage. If this method is not used outside of its class, declare it as private.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Although there is no parameter in the get() method, if any sensitive information is passed via the GET request, it can be exposed because the GET request parameters are included in URL.
Solution: Use POST requests when dealing with sensitive information. If GET requests are necessary, ensure the sensitive information is encrypted.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The get() method returns a static string which might indicate this is a piece of leftover debug code. If left in production, it can expose system details or other sensitive information.
Solution: Remove debug code or information left in the codebase when deploying to production.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify the returned value of the get() method

Details:  
  TestName: verifyReturnValueOfGetMethod
  Description: This test is meant to check if the get() method returns the string "READY". This is the expected behavior of the method as it's specified in the method definition. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there are no input parameters and the method does not depend on any external objects or state.
  Act: Invoke the get() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the string "READY".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the get() method returns the string "READY". This is the expected result because the method's implementation is hardcoded to return this value. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that the method continues to return the expected value even after potential future modifications.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the type of the returned value of the get() method

Details:  
  TestName: verifyReturnTypeOfGetMethod
  Description: This test is meant to check if the get() method returns a value of type String. As per the method definition, the return type should be String.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there are no input parameters and the method does not depend on any external objects or state.
  Act: Invoke the get() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is an instance of the String class.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the get() method returns a String. This is the expected result as per the method's signature. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method's return type is as expected, which is crucial for the correct functioning of the parts of the application that depend on this method.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the behavior of the get() method when invoked multiple times

Details:  
  TestName: verifyBehaviorWhenGetMethodInvokedMultipleTimes
  Description: This test is meant to check if the get() method consistently returns the string "READY" when invoked multiple times. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there are no input parameters and the method does not depend on any external objects or state.
  Act: Invoke the get() method multiple times.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the string "READY" for each invocation.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the get() method consistently returns the string "READY" for each invocation. This is the expected result because the method's implementation is hardcoded to return this value. This test is significant as it ensures that the method behaves consistently across multiple invocations.
