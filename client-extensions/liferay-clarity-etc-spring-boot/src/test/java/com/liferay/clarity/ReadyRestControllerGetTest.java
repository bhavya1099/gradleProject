================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incomplete Code
Issue: The submitted code is incomplete and might not compile because of the missing class and method declarations. This can lead to software crashes, which can be exploited for DOS attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the code is complete before compilation.

Vulnerability: Static Content
Issue: The method returns a static string 'READY', which is not considered a good practice as it may not provide any real time status of the program.
Solution: Check whether the method needs to return a static text or it should perform some operations to return dynamic data.

Vulnerability: Missing Security Annotations
Issue: The REST controller class and/or its methods do not contain Spring Security annotations. It can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive information.
Solution: Use Spring security annotations like @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize, @Secured etc. to restrict access based on user roles.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: Any user input accepted by the application is not validated which can lead to various forms of attacks, like SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Attacks.
Solution: Validate user input on the server side using Spring validation annotations or write custom validation logic.

Vulnerability: Missing Exception Handling
Issue: The code does not have provision for handling exceptions. Unhandled exceptions can reveal system details which can be misused by attackers.
Solution: Add a global exception handler. Mask or log system details while throwing exception messages.

"""
  Scenario 1: Check if method returns correct string

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetReturnCorrectString
    Description: This test is designed to verify if the method 'get' returns the correct String "READY". There are no parameters involved, therefore we expect the result to be consistent every time. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangements are needed as no parameters are involved. 
    Act: Invoke the get method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected String "READY".
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the get method is working as expected and always returns the value "READY". This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of the get method.
  

  Scenario 2: Check if method return is case-sensitive

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetReturnIsCaseSensitive
    Description: This test checks the case sensitivity of the return value from the get method. It asserts that the return value is "READY" in uppercase and not "ready" in lowercase or any other case combination.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangements are needed as the method does not take any parameters. 
    Act: Invoke the get method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected String "READY" and not with "ready" or any other case combination.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the get method returns a String in the expected case. This is important because in certain scenarios, String matchings are case sensitive.

    
  Scenario 3: Check if method return is not null

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetReturnIsNotNull
    Description: The focus of this test is to confirm that the get method doesn't return a null value. This is critical because a null return value could potentially lead to a NullPointerException in the application where this method is consumed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangements are needed, as the method does not take any parameters. 
    Act: Call the get method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertNotNull to check that the returned value is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the get method does not return null. An important safeguard, as null values returned from methods can lead to unexpected errors in software applications.
