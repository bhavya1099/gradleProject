================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
Issue: Logging sensitive information such as JWT Claims, ID, and Subject can expose critical user details. If these logs are mishandled, confidential user data might become available to unauthorized individuals.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information. If it's necessary, ensure logs are properly secured and access is restricted. Use a secure logging library that supports log masking or redaction to hide sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the event of a logging error, the error message could potentially expose sensitive system or user information.
Solution: Implement a global exception handler to catch and handle exceptions. Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages. Instead, use generic error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: Uncontrolled format string could lead to log forging where an attacker can insert malicious content into the logs.
Solution: Ensure to sanitize and escape user-supplied input before logging. Use parameterized logging instead of string concatenation.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when log information is enabled
Details:  
  TestName: testLogInfoEnabled
  Description: This test is meant to check if the log method logs the JWT claims, ID, and subject when the log information is enabled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Jwt and Log classes. Enable log info.
  Act: Call the log method with the mocked Jwt and Log objects.
  Assert: Verify that the info method of the Log class is called with the expected parameters.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the log method logs the correct information when log info is enabled. This is important to ensure that the correct information is logged for debugging and auditing purposes.

Scenario 2: Test when log information is not enabled
Details:  
  TestName: testLogInfoNotEnabled
  Description: This test is meant to check if the log method does not log the JWT claims, ID, and subject when the log information is not enabled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Jwt and Log classes. Disable log info.
  Act: Call the log method with the mocked Jwt and Log objects.
  Assert: Verify that the info method of the Log class is not called.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the log method does not log any information when log info is not enabled. This is important to ensure that unnecessary logging is avoided when not needed.

Scenario 3: Test with null Jwt
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNullJwt
  Description: This test is meant to check if the log method handles a null Jwt object correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Log class. Enable log info. Set Jwt to null.
  Act: Call the log method with the null Jwt and the mocked Log objects.
  Assert: Verify that the info method of the Log class is not called.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the log method does not log any information when the Jwt object is null. This is important to prevent NullPointerExceptions and ensure correct logging behavior.

/*
The test class failed to compile due to a missing POM file in the Maven project directory. This is not a problem with the test cases themselves, but rather with the project setup. To resolve this issue, ensure that the Maven project is correctly set up, with a valid POM file in the correct directory. Also, make sure that you are running the Maven command from the correct directory. No test cases should be commented out as they are not the cause of this issue.
