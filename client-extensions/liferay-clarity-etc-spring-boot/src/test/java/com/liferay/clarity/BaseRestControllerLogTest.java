================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The direct use of unvalidated user inputs such as JWT claims in log files may lead to Log Injection vulnerability. This vulnerability can be used to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information such as JWT Claims directly. If you must, then sanitize and validate the user provided information before logging

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
Issue: Sensitive information such as ID and Subject from JWT tokens are being logged. If an attacker gains access to these logs, they may use this information for malicious purposes.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information. If necessary, sanitize or encrypt the data before logging.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Exceptions may contain sensitive information, which might get exposed if logged or communicated to the user directly.
Solution: Handle exceptions gracefully and avoid sending error details directly to the user. If logs need to be taken for internal use, censor or encrypt sensitive info in logs.

"""
Scenario 1: Test for Checking If the log method is invoked successfully when log.info is enabled

Details:  
  TestName: testIfLogMethodGetsInvokedWhenLogIsInfoEnabled.
  Description: This test will determine whether the log method gets invoked properly, recording and outputting JWT details when isInfoEnabled property under the log object is set to true. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock Jwt, and set the mock Log's isInfoEnabled method to return true.
  Act: Execute the log method.
  Assert: Use verify() method to ensure that the info() function in log method is called.
Validation: 
  The assertion is verifying that the log() function operates correctly and records JWT details whenever the log's info is enabled. This is crucial for tracking and debugging JWT authentication based applications.

Scenario 2: Test for Checking No logging when log.info is not enabled

Details:  
  TestName: testNoLoggingWhenLogIsNotEnabled.
  Description: This test will determine whether the log method does not record JWT details if the isInfoEnabled property for the log object is set to false. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mocking Jwt, and set the mock Log's isInfoEnabled method to return false.
  Act: Execute the log method.
  Assert: Use verify() method to ensure that the info() function in log method is not called.
Validation: 
  The test verifies that the log() function does not record JWT details when the log's info is not enabled. This test ensures that unwanted logging activities are avoided, thus adhering to logging best practices.

Scenario 3: Test for Ensuring Correct Values are Logged

Details:   
  TestName: testVerifyLoggedValues.
  Description: This test ensures correct values are being logged when the log method is invoked. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create Jwt mock and define various methods to return expected values. Set the mock Log's isInfoEnabled() method to return true.
  Act: Invoke the log method.
  Assert: Verify that info() method of log is called with expected values.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the log method logs appropriate JWT claim values. Correct logging of information is important for trouble-free monitoring, debugging and audit logging.

Scenario 4: Test Error handling when JWT is null

Details:  
  TestName: testErrorHandlingWhenJwtIsNull.
  Description: This test checks how the method behaves when the provided Jwt parameter is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a null Jwt object and set up the log mock's isInfoEnabled method to return true.
  Act: Invoke the log method.
  Assert: Verify that the log's info() method is not called.
Validation:
  This test ensures the log method handles null Jwt parameters gracefully without throwing an exception, thus validating its robust error handling capabilities.
