================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Exposing sensitive information through query strings or parameters in HTTP GET requests may expose that information in logs or browser history. In Java, if sensitive data is passed in a GET request, it can cause information disclosure vulnerabilities.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive data through GET request and use HTTP POST method instead, or encrypt the data before appending it to the URL.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The 'get' method does not include any form of user authentication restricting access to the underlying resource. This may allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
Solution: Implement proper authentication and session management. Only authenticated users should be allowed to access protected resources.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The Spring Framework version in use may not have CSRF protections enabled by default. Without robust CSRF protection, attackers may trick end users into executing malicious actions on their behalf.
Solution: Enable CSRF protection provided by the Spring Security framework. Regularly update and patch the Spring Framework to maintain security integrity.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Happy Path Test on The Get Method
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetResponseStatus
    Description: This test checks if the 'get' method executes successfully, with the goal to ensure that a successful status message "READY" is returned when the method is called. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange required as no parameter or conditions are required for the method.
    Act: Invoke the 'get' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the expected result "READY" equals to the actual result.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the 'get' method returns the correct status message upon successful execution. It's an essential test as the expected behavior of the 'get' method in the context of application logic is to return "READY".

Scenario 2: Test for Null Response
  Details:  
    TestName: testNullResponse
    Description: This test checks if the 'get' method can handle when null status message is received, which should normally not happen if the 'get' method works correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Modify the 'get' method temporarily to return null.
    Act: Invoke the 'get' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the actual result is null.
  Validation: 
    By expecting null we validate the possibility of the 'get' method returning a null response. This test is essential to cover the edge case of a null return, which can be used to trigger appropriate error handling mechanisms.

Scenario 3: Test for Different Response
  Details:  
    TestName: testDifferentResponse
    Description: This test verifies if the 'get' method behaves correctly when the expected message is altered.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Modify the 'get' method temporarily to return a different status message, for example "NOT READY".
    Act: Invoke the 'get' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the actual result equals to the new expected result "NOT READY".
  Validation: 
    This test is to validate if the 'get' method can handle changes in the expected return message and is particularly useful while debugging. With this unusual scenario, we can evaluate application's robustness.
